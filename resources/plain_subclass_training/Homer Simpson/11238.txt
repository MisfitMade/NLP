Let us curl, M'lady. Let us throw and sweep a'twain until the Heavens themselves drop their jaws in wonder and envy! And afterwards there'll be beer, and cocoa, with marshmallows floating in the foam. And if, from now till the end of time, someone should ask what we were doing on the eve of the seventeenth of November, we shall proclaim that WE WERE CURLING!
