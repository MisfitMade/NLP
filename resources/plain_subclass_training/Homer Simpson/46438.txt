Never! Never, Marge! I can't live the buttoned-down life like you. I want it all: the terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the creamy middles. Sure I might offend a few of the bluenoses with my cocky-stride and musky odors. Oh, I'll never be the darling of the so called "City Fathers" who cluck their tongues, stroke their beards, and talk about what's to be done with this Homer Simpson.
