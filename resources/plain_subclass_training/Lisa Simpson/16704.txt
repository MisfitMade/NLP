I'M IN THE FINAL TWO / I SHOULD BE HAPPY / BUT ALL I WANT TO DO / IS SPEND MORE TIME WITH MY PAPPY... NOW THAT YOU'RE GONE, DAD, I MISS YOU SO MUCH / AND YOUR THREATS AGAINST TEAMSTERS AND TECHIES AND SUCH / YOUR MANAGEMENT STYLE IS LIKE ATTILA THE HUN / YOU WERE VICIOUS, MALICIOUS, BUT YOU GOT THE JOB DONE...
