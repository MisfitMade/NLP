Well, it doesn't matter how you feel inside, you know. It's what comes from the top that matters. That's what my mother taught me. Take all your bad feelings and push them down, down and down, past your knees, until you're almost walking on them. And then you'll fit in, and you'll be invited to parties, and the boys will love you... and happiness will follow.
