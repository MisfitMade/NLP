Dear Friends of the Simpson Family: This year has brought us some sadness and some joy. Sadness first. Our little cat, Snowball, ran away unexpectedly and went to kitty heaven. But we bought a new little cat, Snowball II... so I guess life will go on. Speaking of life going on, Grampa is still with us, cheerful as ever. Maggie is walking by herself. Lisa gets straight A's, and Bart, well... we love Bart. The magic of the season has touched us allâ€¦
