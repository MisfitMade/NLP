Dear Friends of the Simpson Family: We have had our share of sorrows and joys this year. First the sadness. Our little cat, Snowball, had an unexpected stroke and went to kitty heaven. But we bought a new kitten, Snowball II ... so I guess life goes on. Speaking of living on, Grampa is still with us, as active as ever. Maggie walks alone. Lisa gets straight A's, and Bart, well... we like Bart. We have all been touched by the magic of the season...
