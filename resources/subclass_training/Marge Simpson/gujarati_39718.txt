Hello, everyone. You know, Halloween is a very strange holiday. Personally, I don't understand it. Children worshiping ghosts, pretending to be devils... T.V. on things that are completely inappropriate for young viewers. Things like the following half hour. Nothing bothers my kids, but tonight's show, which I'm totally washing my hands of, is really scary, so if you have sensitive kids, you should go to bed early tonight instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow. . Thank you for your attention.
