Well, it doesn't matter what you look like inside, you know. It is what appears on the surface that counts. That's what my mother taught me. Remove all your bad feelings and push them down, past your knees, until you're almost walking on them. And then you fit in, and you get invited to parties, and guys like you...and happiness follows.
