Well, it doesn't matter how you feel inside, you know. What appears on the surface matters. That's what my mother taught me. Take all your bad feelings and push them down, down past your knees, until you're almost walking on them. And then you'll fit in and get invited to parties and the boys will like you...and happiness will follow.
