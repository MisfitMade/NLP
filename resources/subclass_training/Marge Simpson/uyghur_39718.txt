Hello, everyone. You know, Halloween is a very strange holiday. Personally, I don't understand it. Kids worship ghosts, pretend to be devils... Things on T.V. are totally inappropriate for young viewers. Things like the following half hour. Nothing seems to bother my kids, but the show I completely washed my hands of today is truly horrible, so if you have sensitive kids, you should put them to bed early tonight instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow. Thank you for your attention.
