Dear Friends of the Simpson Family: We had some sadness and some joy this year. First the sadness. Our little cat, Snowball, had a sudden hit and went to kitten heaven. But we got a new little cat, Snowball II... so I guess life goes on. Speaking of life going on, Grampa is still with us, brave as ever. Maggie is walking by herself. Lisa got A's, and Bart, well... we love Bart. The magic of the season has touched us all...
