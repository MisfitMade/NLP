Hello, everyone. You know, Halloween is a wonderful holiday. Personally, I don't understand it. Kids worshiping ghosts, pretending to be devils... T.V. stuff. which is totally inappropriate for young viewers. Things like the next half hour. Nothing seems to bother my kids, but tonight's show, which I completely washed my hands of, was really scary, so if you have sensitive kids, maybe you should put them to bed earlier tonight, instead of to write us angry letters tomorrow. Thank you for your attention.
