Hello everyone. You know, Halloween is a very strange holiday. Personally, I don't understand. Kids worshiping ghosts, pretending to be demons...things that are totally inappropriate for young viewers on TV. Things like the next half hour. Nothing seems to bother my kids, but tonight's show, which I completely wash my hands of, is really scary, so if you have sensitive kids, maybe you should put them to bed early tonight instead of writing angry letters tomorrow. Thank you for your attention.
