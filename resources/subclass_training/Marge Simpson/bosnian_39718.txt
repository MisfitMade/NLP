Hello everyone. You know, Halloween is a very strange holiday. Personally, I don't understand it. Kids worshiping ghosts, pretending to be devils...things on TV that are totally inappropriate for younger viewers. Things like the next half hour. My kids don't seem to mind, but tonight's show I'm completely washing my hands of is really scary, so if you have sensitive kids, maybe you should tuck them into bed earlier instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow. Thank you for your attention.
