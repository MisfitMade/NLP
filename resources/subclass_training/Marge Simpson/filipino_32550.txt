They say when you kiss the Blarney Stone, you get "gab's gift." Which is great, but I'm not sure I like the idea of ​​getting a gift in exchange for a kiss. What kind of message is that for Lisa and Maggie? Those are my daughters. But on the other hand, America doesn't have any rocks to kiss -- except for Stone Phillips. Do you have one of his here? If so, he is yours.
