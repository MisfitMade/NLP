Dear Friends of The Simpsons: We've had some sadness and some joy this year. First of all the sadness. Our little cat, Snowball, was unexpectedly run over and went to feline heaven. But we got a new little cat, Snowball II... so I guess life goes on. Speaking of life going on, Grampa is still with us, as energetic as ever. Maggie goes alone. Lisa has straight A's, and Bart, well... we love Bart. The magic of the season has touched us all...
