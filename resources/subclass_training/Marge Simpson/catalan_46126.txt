Well, it doesn't matter how you feel inside, you know. What counts is what appears on the surface. This is what my mother taught me. Take all your bad feelings and push them down, down, past your knees, until you're almost walking them. And then you'll fit in, get invited to parties, and the boys will like you...and happiness will follow.
