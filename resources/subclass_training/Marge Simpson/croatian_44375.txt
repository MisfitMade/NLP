Dear friends of the Simpson family: We have had some sadness and some joy this year. First the sadness. Our little cat, Snowball, was unexpectedly run over and went to cat heaven. But we bought a new little kitty, Snowball II...so I guess life goes on. Speaking of life, Grandpa is still with us, fighting as always. Maggie walks alone. Lisa got a straight A, and Bart, well... we love Bart. The magic of the season has touched us all...
