Umm... Hello. My name is Marge Simpson and I painted it. You might like to know what made me do it. Well, I guess I wanted to show that beneath Mr. Burns' fearsome head, with its cruel lips, vicious tongue, and wicked brain, there was a frail withered body—perhaps not long for this world—as vulnerable and beautiful as anyone else's. God's creation.
