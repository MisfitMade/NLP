Hello everyone. You know, Halloween is a very strange holiday. Personally, I don't understand it. Kids worshiping ghosts, pretending to be devils... what's on T.V. Not suitable for younger audiences. Things like the following half hour. Nothing seems to bother my kids, but tonight's show, where I wash all my hands, is absolutely terrifying, so if you have sensitive kids, maybe you should go to bed early tonight, instead of writing us an angry letter tomorrow. Thank you for your interest.
