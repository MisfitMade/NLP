Dear Friends of the Simpson Family: This year has had both sadness and joy. First the sadness. Our little cat, Snowball, was unexpectedly run over and went to cat heaven. But we bought a new little cat, Snowball II...so I guess life goes on. Speaking of life going on, Grandpa is still with us, fierce as ever. Maggie is walking alone. Lisa got A's and Bart, well...we love Bart. The magic of the season touched us all...
