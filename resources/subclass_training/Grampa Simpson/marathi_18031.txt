One trick is to tell them stories that don't go anywhere...like the time I caught the ferry to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so I decided to go to Morganville, which was called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, that was the style of the time... Now it took a nickel to make a round, and in those days there were pictures of beetles on the nickels. "Give me five bees for a quarter" you say. Now, where were we? Oh yes, the important thing was that I had an onion on my katta, that was the style of the time. Because of the war they didn't have white onion...
