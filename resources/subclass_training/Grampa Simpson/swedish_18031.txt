One trick is to tell stories to those who aren't going anywhere... Like when I took the ferry across to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so I decided to go to Morganville, which was what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style of the day... now it cost a nickel to take the ferry, and in those days nickels had pictures of bumblebees. "Give me five bees for a quarter" you would say. Where were we now? Oh yes, the important thing was that I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They had no white onions because of the warâ€¦
