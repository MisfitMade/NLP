One trick is to tell them stories that don't go anywhere...like the time I took the ferry to Shelbyville. I needed a new sole for my shoe, so I decided to go to Morganville, which they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion in my belt, which was the style of the time... Now it cost a nickel to take a ferry, and in those days there were pictures of bees on the nickels. "Give me five bees for a quarter" you will say. Now, where were we? Yes, the important thing was that I had a bow in my belt, which was the style of the time. They didn't have white onions, because of the war...
