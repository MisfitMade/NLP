Homer, I think Rudyard Kipling said it best: "If you could pile up all your winnings and risk it in one round of pitching and throwing and losing, and start over at your beginnings and never breathe a word about your loss... Yours is the earth and all that is in it. And -- what is more -- you will be a man, my son.
