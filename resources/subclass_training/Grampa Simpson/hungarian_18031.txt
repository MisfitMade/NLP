One trick is to tell them stories that lead nowhere... Like the time I came to Shelbyville by ferry. I needed new heels for my shoes, so I decided to go to Morganville, then called Shelbyville. So I tied an onion on my belt, which was the style back then... now it cost a nickel to get on the ferry, and back then nickels had pictures of bumble bees on them. "Give me five bees for a quarter," you would say. Well, where were we? Yes, the important thing was that I had an onion on my belt, that was the style at that time. Because of the war, they didn't have white onions...
