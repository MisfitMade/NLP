One trick is to tell them stories where nothing will happen...like when I took the ferry to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoes, so I decided to go to Morganville, which they called Shelbyville at the time. So I tied an onion to my belt and that's the style of the day...it costs 5 cents to take the ferry now, and in those days, the 5 cents had pictures of bumblebees on them. You would say "give me five bees a quarter". Now, where are we? Oh yes, the important thing was that I had an onion on my belt, which was the style of the day. They don't have white onions because of the war...
