Well, you're actually asking two questions there. The first takes me back to 1934. Admiral Byrd had just arrived at the Pole, only hours before the Three Stooges...And I guess he won the argument, but I went with the turnips. The next morning, I resigned from my job as a coast guard. The next thing I heard was that there was a civil war in Spain.
