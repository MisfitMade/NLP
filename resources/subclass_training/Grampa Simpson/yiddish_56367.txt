Well, you are actually asking two questions there. The first takes me back to 1934. Admiral Byrd had just reached the Poles, just hours ahead of the Three Stooges...and I guess he won the argument, but I walked away with the turnip. The next morning I resigned my commission in the coast guard. The next thing I heard, there was a civil war in Spain.
