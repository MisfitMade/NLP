One trick is to tell them stories that go nowhere... like I took the ferry to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoes, so I decided to go to Morganville, which they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style of the day... Now it cost a nickel to get a boat, and in those days there were pictures of bumblebees on the nickels. "Give me five flies for a quarter" you say. Now, where were we? Oh yes, the important thing was that I had an onion on my belt, which was the style of the time. Because of the war they didn't have white onions...
