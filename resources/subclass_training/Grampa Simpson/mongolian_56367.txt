Well, you're really asking two questions there. The first takes me back to 1934. Admiral Byrd reached the pole a few hours before the Three Sandals... So he probably won the argument, but I took my turnips with me. The next morning I resigned from the Coast Guard Commission. The next thing I heard, there was a civil war in Spain.
