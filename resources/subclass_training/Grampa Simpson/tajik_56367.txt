Well, you're really asking two questions there. The first one takes me back to 1934. Admiral Byrd had just reached the Pole, just a few hours ahead of the Three Stooges... And I guess he won the argument, but I went with the turnip. The next morning I resigned my commission in the Coast Guard. What I heard was a civil war in Spain.
