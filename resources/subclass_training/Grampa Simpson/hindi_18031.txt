One trick is to tell them stories that go nowhere... like the time I took the ferry to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoes, so I decided to move to Morganville, which they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time... Now it costs a nickel to ferry, and in those days nickels used to have pictures of bumblebees. "Give me five bees for a quarter" you would say. where were we now? Oh yes, the special thing was that I had an onion on my belt, which was the style of that time. He didn't have white onions because of the war.
