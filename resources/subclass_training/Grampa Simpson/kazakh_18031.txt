One trick is to tell them stories that go nowhere...like when I caught the ferry to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoes, so I decided to go to Morganville, which was then called Shelbyville. So I tied an onion in my belt, that was the style back then... now it costs a nickel to take the ferry, and back then the nickels had pictures of bees on them. "Give me five quarters," you say. Now where were we? Oh, yes, and most importantly, I had an onion on my belt, which was the style of the day. They didn't have white onions, because of the war...
