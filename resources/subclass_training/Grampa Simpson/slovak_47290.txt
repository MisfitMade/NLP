Homer, I think Rudyard Kipling said it best: â€œIf you can make one pile of all your winnings and risk it in one turn of the pitch and roll and lose and start over from your beginnings and never breathe about your loss. The earth is yours and everything that is on it. And - what's more - you will be a man, my son."
