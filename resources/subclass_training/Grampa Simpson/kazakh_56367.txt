You are really asking two questions. The first takes me back to 1934. Admiral Byrd had just reached the Pole, just a few hours before the Three Stooges... And I think he won the argument, but I walked away with the turnip. The next morning I resigned my commission in the Coast Guard. The next thing I heard was the civil war in Spain.
