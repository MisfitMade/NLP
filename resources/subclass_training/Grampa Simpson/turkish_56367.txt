You're really asking two questions there. The first takes me back to 1934. Admiral Byrd had just arrived at the Pole, just hours before the Three Fellows... And I think he won the argument, but I walked away with the turnips. The next morning, I resigned from my position with the coast guard. What I heard next was that there was a civil war in Spain.
