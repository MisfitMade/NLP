One trick is to tell them stories that don't go anywhere...like the time you got on the ferry to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoes, so I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, and that was the style back then... Now the cost of a ferry ride was a nickel, and in those days the nickel had pictures of bumblebees. You'll say, "Give me five bees for a quarter." And now where were we? Oh yeah, the important thing is that I had an onion on my belt, and that was the style at the time. They didn't have white onions because of the war...
