Well, you're really asking two questions there. The first takes me back to 1934. Admiral Byrd had just reached the Pole, just hours before the Three Stooges... And I guess he won, but I left with the turnips. The next morning, I resigned my commission in the Coast Guard. The next thing I heard was the civil war in Spain.
