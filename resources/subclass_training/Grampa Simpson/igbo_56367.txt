Well, you're asking two questions there. The first brings me back to 1934. Admiral Byrd just arrived at the tree, just a few hours before the third Stooges ... But I think he won the argument, but I left with turnips. The next morning, I was off duty with the Coast Guard. The next thing I heard was that there was a civil war in Spain.
