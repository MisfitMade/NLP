Number one is to tell them stories that don't go anywhere... like when I caught the ferry to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so I decided to go to Morganville, which they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied onions to my belt, that's the way it was thenâ€¦ now it cost a penny to get on the ferry, and in those days the nickels had pictures of bumblebees on them. You'd say, "Give me five bees for a quarter." Now, where were we? Ah yes, the important thing was that I had onions on my belt, which was the fashion of the time. They didn't have white onions, because of the war...
