One trick is to tell them stories that lead nowhere... Like the time I caught the ferry to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoes, so I decided to go to Morganville, which they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style of the day...now it cost a nickel to take the ferry, and in those days there were pictures of bumblebees on the nickels. "Give me five bees for a quarter," you say. Now where were we? Oh yes, the important thing was that I had an onion on my belt, which was the style of the time. They didn't have white onions because of the war...
