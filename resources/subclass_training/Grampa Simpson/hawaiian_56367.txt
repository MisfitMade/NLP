Well, you're asking two questions there. The first takes me back to 1934. Admiral Byrd reached the Pole, just hours before the Three Stooges...And I thought he won the argument, but I went with turnips. The next morning, I left my commission on guard duty. From what I have heard, there is a civil war in Spain.
