Well, you're asking two questions there. The first takes me back to 1934. Admiral Byrd had just arrived at the Pole, just a few hours before the Three Stooges...And I think he won the argument, but I left with turnips. The next morning, I quit my job in the coast guard. The next thing I heard, there was a civil war in Spain.
