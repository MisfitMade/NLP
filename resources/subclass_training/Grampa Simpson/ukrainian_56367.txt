Well, you're really asking two questions. The first takes me back to 1934. Admiral Byrd had just reached the pole, just a few hours ahead of the Three Stooges... And I guess he won the argument, but I went with the turnip. I resigned from the Coast Guard the next morning. The next thing I heard, there was a civil war in Spain.
