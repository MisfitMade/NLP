Well, you're really asking two questions. The first takes me back to 1934. Admiral Byrd just reached the pole, just a few hours ahead of the Three Stooges... And I guess he won the argument, but I went with the turnip. I left the Coast Guard the next morning. The next thing I heard was the Spanish Civil War.
