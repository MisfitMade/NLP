One trick is to tell them stories that go nowhere... Like the time I caught the ferry to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so I decided to go to Morganville, which they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time... taking the ferry now cost a nickel, and in those days nickels had pictures of bumblebees on them. "Give me five bees for a quarter" you would say. Now, where were we? Oh yes, most importantly I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn't have white onions, because of the war...
