One trick is to tell them stories that go nowhere...like the time I caught the ferry to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoes, so I decided to go to Morganville, which they called Shelbyville in those days. So I put an onion on my belt, that was the style then...now it cost a nickel to get on the ferry, and in those days the nickels had pictures of bees on them. "Give me five bees for a quarter," you say. Now where were we? Yes, the important thing was that I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn't have white onions, because there was a war...
