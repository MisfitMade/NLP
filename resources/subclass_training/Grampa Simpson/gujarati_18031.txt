One trick is to tell them stories that lead nowhere... like I caught the ferry to Shelbyville. I needed new heels for my shoes, so I decided to go to Morganville, which they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion in my belt, which was the style then... now it costs a nickel to take the ferry, and in those days there were pictures of eyebrows on the nickel. "Give me five bees for a quarter" you say. Now, where were we? Oh yes, the important thing was that I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. Because of the war they didn't have white onions...
