Well, you're actually asking two questions there. The first one took me back to 1934. Admiral Byrd had just reached the Pole, just a few hours before the Three Stooges... And I guess he won the argument, but I walked away with the turnip. The next morning, I resigned from duty as coast guard. Next thing I heard, there was civil war in Spain.
