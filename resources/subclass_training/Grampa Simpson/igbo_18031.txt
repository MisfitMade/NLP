One trick is to tell them a story that doesn't go anywhere... Like the time I caught a boat in Shelbyville. I needed new heels for my shoes, so I decided to go to Morganville, then called Shelbyville. So I tied an onion to my string, which was kind of at the time...now it cost a nickel to ship, and in those days nickels had pictures of bumblebees on them. "Give me five bees for a quarter" you say. Now, where are we? Oh yes, the important thing is that I have an onion in my belt, which was a style at that time. They don't have white onions, because of the war...
