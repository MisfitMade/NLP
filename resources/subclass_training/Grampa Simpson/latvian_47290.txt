Homer, I think Rudyard Kipling said it best: "If you can make one pile of all your winnings, and risk it in one turn of the game, roll and lose, and start over with your beginning, and never breathe a sigh of relief at your loss. Your is the earth and all that is in it And—what is more—you shall be a man, my son.
