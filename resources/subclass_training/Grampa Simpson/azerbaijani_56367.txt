Well, you're really asking two questions there. The first takes me back to 1934. Admiral Byrd had just reached the Pole, just a few hours before the Three Stooges... And I guess he won the argument, but I walked away with the turnips. The next morning I resigned from the coast guard commission. The next thing I heard was the civil war in Spain.
