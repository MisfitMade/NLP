Homer, I think Rudyard Kipling said it best: "If you can make one pile of all your winnings and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss and miss, and start again at your beginning and never breathe a sigh of relief. The earth is yours, and all that is in it. And -- what's more -- you'll be a man, my son."
