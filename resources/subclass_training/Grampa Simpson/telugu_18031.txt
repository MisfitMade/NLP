One trick is to tell them stories that go nowhere...like the time I caught the ferry to Shelbyville. My shoe needed a new heel so I decided to go to Morganville, then called Shelbyville. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style back then... Now it costs a nickel to take the ferry, and in those days there were pictures of bumblebees on the nickels. "Give me five bees a quarter," you say. Now, where are we? Oh, the important thing was that I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They don't have white onions, because of the war...
