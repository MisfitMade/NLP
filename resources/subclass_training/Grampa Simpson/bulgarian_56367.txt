Well, you're really asking two questions. The first takes me back to 1934. Admiral Byrd had just reached the pole, just hours before the Three Stooges... And I guess he won the argument, but I walked away with the turnip. The next morning I quit my Coast Guard post. The next thing I heard was a civil war in Spain.
