Another trick is to tell them stories that don't go anywhere... Like when I caught the ferry to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so I decided to go to Morganville, which was what they called Shelbyville back then. So I put an onion on my belt, which was the way back then... a boat ride cost a nickel, and in those days nickels had pictures of bumblebees on them. "Give me five bees for a quarter" you might say. So, where were we? Yes, the important thing was that I had an onion on my belt, which was the trend at that time. They didn't have white onion, because of the war...
