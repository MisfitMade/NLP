One job is to tell them stories that don't go anywhere... Like when I caught the car in Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so I decided to go to Morganville, which was the name of Shelbyville in those days. So I tied a ribbon to my belt, which was the way it was... now for a ride it was a nickel, and in those days there were pictures of bumblebees on the nickels. "Give me five bucks for a quarter" you say. So, where are we? Well, the main thing is that I have a leech on my belt, which is what it was like back then. No white onions, because of the war...
