One trick is to tell stories that go nowhere... Like the time I caught the ferry to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so I decided to go to Morganville, which was what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the fashion of the time... now it cost a nickel to pick up a ferret, and in those days nickels had pictures of bees on them. "Give me five bees for a quarter" you would say. Now where were we? Yes, the important thing is that I had an onion on my belt, which was fashionable at the time. They didn't have white onions, because of the war...
