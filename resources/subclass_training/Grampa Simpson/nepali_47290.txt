Homer, I think Rudyard Kipling said it best: "If you could make a pile of all your winnings and pitch and toss and risk a turn of losses, and start over at your beginning and about your losses Breathe not a word. The earth and all that is in it is yours. And -- more than that -- you shall be a man, my son."
