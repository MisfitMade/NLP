Homer, I think Rudyard Kipling said it best: â€œIf you can make one pile of all your winnings and risk it on one swing of the pitch and roll and lose, and start over from your beginnings and never breathe a word about your loss. Yours is the earth and all that is in it. And - what is more - you will be a man, my son."
