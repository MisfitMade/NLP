One trick is to tell them stories that go nowhere... Like the time I took the ferry to Shelbyville. I needed new heels for my shoes, so I decided to go to Morganville, which was called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style then...now it cost a nickel to take the ferry, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bees on them. "Give me five bees for a quarter," you would say. Now, where were we? Yes, the important thing was that I had an onion in my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn't have white onions, because of the dust...
