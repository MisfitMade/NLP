Dear Family: I am a total failure and you would be better off without me. I will be in my water grave when you read this. I can only leave you with the words my father gave me: "Stand up, have courage, and never give up." I just wish I could provide a better model in death than in life. Warmest regards, Ihomer J. Simpson.
