Let's curl up, lady. Let's throw and sweep a'twain till the heavens themselves drop their jaws in wonder and envy! And then there will be beer and cocoa, with marshmallows floating in the foam. And if from now until the end of time someone asks what we did on the eve of the seventeenth of November, we will announce that we are OUR CHILDREN!
