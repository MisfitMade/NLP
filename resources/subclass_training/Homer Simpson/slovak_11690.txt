Dear Family: I am a total failure and you will be better off without me. I will be in my watery grave by the time you read this. I can only leave you with the words my father gave me: 'Stand up, have courage and never give up.' I only hope I can provide a better model in death than I did in life. Sincerely, love Homer J. Simpson.
