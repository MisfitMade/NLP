You are right, Marge. Just like the time I could have met Mr. T at the mall. All day I kept saying, I'll go a little later, I'll go a little later. And then when I arrived, they told me he had just left. And when I asked the guy at the mall if he would ever come back, he said he didn't know. Well, I will never let something like that happen again. I'm going to space now.
