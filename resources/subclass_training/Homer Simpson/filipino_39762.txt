Oh, hi! Ricky Gervais, umm it's an honor to meet you, Sir Ridley. I like your movies. Or as I call them, "movies." Umm, I'm glad I bumped into you, actually. Because, uh, I'm looking to expand beyond comedy. I know what you're thinking, Sir Ridley. You're thinking "Oh my word, he's been making fun of me all these years, but now he's moving me too. I'm gonna have to put him in my new film. What do you think?
