Look, Marge, you don't know what it is. I'm the one every day, putting his ass on the line. And I'm not out of order. You are out of order. The whole freakin' system is out of order. Do you want the truth? Do you want the truth? You can't handle the truth. Because if you get there and put your hand in the pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do. Forget it, Marge - it's Chinatown.
