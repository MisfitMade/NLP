Son, the woman is very much like, uh... ...a refrigerator. They're about six feet tall, 300 pounds... they make ice and... Oh, wait a minute, actually a woman is like a beer! They smell good -- they look good -- you'd step over your mom for one! But you can't stop at one. You want to drink another woman!
