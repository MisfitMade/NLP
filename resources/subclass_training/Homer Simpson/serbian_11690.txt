Dear Family: I am a complete failure and you will be better off without me. By the time you read this, I will be in my watery grave. I can only leave you with the words my father gave me: 'Stand tall, have courage and never give up.' I only hope that I can provide a better model in death than in life. Sincerely, Love Homer J. Simpson.
