Ohhhhh, Marge! This will be the biggest night of your life. I've been saving up for a new engine for my car, but I'm going to spend it all on us. I am renting the biggest limousine. I'll buy you the biggest corsage. My tuxedo will have the widest lapels, the most ruffles, and the highest platform shoes you've ever seen.
