You're right, Marge. Like the time I met Mr.T at the mall. All day, I kept saying, I'll walk a little, I'll walk a little.' And then when I got there, they told me that he just left. And when I asked the mall if he was coming back, he didn't know. Well, I won't let it happen again. I'm going to space, now.
