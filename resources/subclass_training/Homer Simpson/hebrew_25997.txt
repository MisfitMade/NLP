stop that! stop that! stop that! How dare you talk about Ned Flanders like that! He is a wonderful, kind, caring man. Maybe even more than me. There were times when I lost patience with him, even lashed out at him. But this man turned every cheek in his body. If everyone here was like Ned Flanders, there would be no need for heaven. We were already there.
