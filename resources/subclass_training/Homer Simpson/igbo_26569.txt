Yes. I really am. Hello there, Itchy. I know there are a lot of people who don't like me and want me to leave, but I think we got off on the wrong foot. I know I can come off a little, and I'm sorry for that. And if everyone can find a place in their heart for a little unwanted dog, I know we can make them laugh - and cry - until we grow up together.
