Yes. Definitely yes. Hello, itch. I know there are a lot of people who don't like me and want me gone, but I think I got off on the wrong foot. I know I can be a bit proactive and for that I'm sorry. But if everyone could find a place in their hearts for the dog no one wanted, I know we can make them laugh -- and cry -- until we grow old together.
