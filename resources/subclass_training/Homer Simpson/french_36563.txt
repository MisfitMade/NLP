Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, crawls in this little rhythm from day to day, until the last syllable of recorded time. And all our yesterdays have turned on madmen. The dusty road to death. Outside, short candle! Life is just a walking shadow, a bad player. Who struts and bustles his hour on the stage. And then we hear nothing.
