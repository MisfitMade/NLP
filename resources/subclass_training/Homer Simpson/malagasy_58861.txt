Look, Marge, you don't know what it's like. I'm there every day, putting my ass on the line. And I'm not out of date. You are restless. Every freakin system is unstable. Do you want the truth? Do you want the truth? You can't handle the truth. Because when you reach out and put your hand in the goo that is your best friend's face, you'll know what to do. Forget it, Marge - it's Chinatown.
