Yes. I certainly do. Hey, Itchy. I know there are a lot of people who don't like me and wish I would go away, but I think we got off on the wrong foot. I know I can be a bit proactive and I'm sorry for that. But if everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little dog no one wanted, I know we can make them laugh—and cry—until we grow old together.
