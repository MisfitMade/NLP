Stupid Flanders... always showing off. Go ahead, Marge, have a ball... What if they game back and I was dead from not eating? They'd cry their eyes out. We should have never gone to the Flanders'. Oh, why did we go to the Flanders' house and leave Homer all alone with no food. And I'd be laughing. Laughing from my grave.
