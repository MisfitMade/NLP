Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! How dare you say that about Ned Flanders! He is a wonderful, kind, caring person. Maybe more than me. There were times when I lost patience with him and even quarreled with him. But this man turned all the jaws of his body. If everyone here was like Ned Flanders, there would be no need for heaven. We would already be there.
