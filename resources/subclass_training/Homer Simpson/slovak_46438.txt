Never! Never, Marge! I can't live a switched on life like you. I want it all: terrifying lows, dizzying highs, creamy mids. Sure, I might offend a few bluenoses with my arrogant stride and musky smell. Oh, I will never be a darling of the so-called "City Fathers" who click their tongues, stroke their mustaches, and talk about what to do with this Homer Simpson.
