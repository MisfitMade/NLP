Mr. Burns, before I go, I have a few things to get off my chest: One: I liked the new microwave in the break room -- just push "popcorn." You don't need to know how long. Two: Replacing us with robots is heartless and despicable. Three: how about a farewell party with a caricature artist? You know it's something both kids and adults can enjoy. So to summarize: nicely done, we hate you, and food for thought.
