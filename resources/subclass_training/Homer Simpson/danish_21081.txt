I'm so sorry I threw you across the room and called you a liar. When you told me I weighed two hundred and sixty pounds, you just encouraged me. It was a poem you wrote about my potential. I want to start celebrating my size and I need you with me as a partner. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to talk to the broken porch swing.
