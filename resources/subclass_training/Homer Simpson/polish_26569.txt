Yes. Certainly yes. Hello, Itchy. I know there are many people who don't like me and would like me to leave, but I think we went in the wrong direction. I know I can go a little proactive and I'm sorry for that. But if everyone could find a place in their heart for a little doggie that nobody wanted, I know we can make him laugh - and cry - until we grow old together.
