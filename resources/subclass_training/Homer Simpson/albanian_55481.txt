You know, I've been thinking... Everyone makes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but usually the jelly drips down the sides and some guy's hands get all sticky. But your jelly sits right in the middle where it should. I don't know how you do it. You just have a gift, I think. I've always thought so. I just never mentioned it. But it's time you know how I feel. I don't believe in keeping feelings bottled up. ...Goodbye, my wife.
