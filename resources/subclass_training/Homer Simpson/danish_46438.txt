Never! Never, Marge! I can't live the buttoned up life like you. I want it all: the terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the creamy mids. Sure I can offend a few bluenoses with my cocky steps and musky smells. Oh, I will never be the darling of the so-called "City Fathers" who cluck their tongues, stroke their beards, and talk about what to do with this Homer Simpson.
