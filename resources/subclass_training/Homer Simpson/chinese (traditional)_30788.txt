You are right, Marg. Like when I met Mr. T at the mall. All day, I've been saying, I'll go later, I'll go later. Then when I got there, they told me he just left. When I asked the guy at the mall if he would come again, he said he didn't know. Well, I will never let something like this happen again. I'm going to space, now.
