Come on Marge, I want to dust off this one-horse town. I want to explore the world. I want to watch TV in a different time zone. I want to visit strange foreign malls. I'm sick of eating hoagies. I want a grinder, a sub, a foot-tall hero. I want to live, Marge! Won't you let me live? Won't you please?
