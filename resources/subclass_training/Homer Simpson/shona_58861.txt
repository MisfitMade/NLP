Look, Marge, you don't know what it's like. I'm there every day, putting his ass on the line. And I'm not out of order. You are out of order. The whole freakin' system is messed up. Do you want the truth? Do you want the truth? You can't handle the truth. Because when you reach and put your hand in the goo storm that was your best friend's face, you will know what to do. Forget it, Marge - it's Chinatown.
