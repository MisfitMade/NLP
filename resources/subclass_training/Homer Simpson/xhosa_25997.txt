Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! How can you talk about Ned Flanders like that! He is a wonderful, kind, caring man. Maybe even more than me. There were times when I lost patience with him, I even shouted at him. But this man has changed all the cheeks in his body. If everyone here was like Ned Flanders, there would be no need for heaven. We are already there.
