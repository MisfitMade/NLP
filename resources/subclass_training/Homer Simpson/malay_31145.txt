Mr. Burns, before I go, I have a few things to get out of the way: one: I love the new microwave in the break room -- just minus the "popcorn". You don't need to know how long. Two: replacing us with robots is heartless and despicable. Three: what about the farewell party with the caricature artist? You know, it's something that both kids and adults can enjoy. So to summarize: well done, we hate you, and food for thought.
