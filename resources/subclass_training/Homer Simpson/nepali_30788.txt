You're right, Marge. Like the time I met Mr. T at the mall. All day, I kept saying I'll go a little later, I'll go a little later. And then when I got there, they told me he just left. And when I asked the mall guy if he would ever come back, he said he didn't know. Well, I won't let that happen again. I'm going to space now.
