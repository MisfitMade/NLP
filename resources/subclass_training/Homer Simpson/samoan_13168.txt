Come on Marge, I want to shake off the dust of this one horse sacrifice. I want to study the world. I want to watch TV in another time zone. I want to visit different shops. I'm sick of eating hoagies. I want a tower, a small one, a foot tall hero. I want to live, Marge! Won't you let me live? Won't you please?
