Mr. Burns, before I go, I need to get a few things off my chest: One: I loved the new microwave in the break room -- just press "popcorn." You don't need to know how long. Second: replacing us with robots is heartless and disgusting. Third: how about a farewell party with a cartoonist? You know, it's something that both kids and adults can enjoy. So to recap: nicely done, we hate you and food for thought.
