Look, Marge, you don't know what this is. I'm here every day kicking his ass. And I'm out of line. You are not okay. The whole damn system is down. Do you want the truth? Do you want the truth? You can't handle the truth. Because if you reach out and stick your hand into the pile of slime that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do. Forget it, Marge is Chinatown.
