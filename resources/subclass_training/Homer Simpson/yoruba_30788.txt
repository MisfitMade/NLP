You're right, Marge. Like the time I might have met Mr. T at the store. Every day, I'm saying, I'm going to go a little bit, I'm going to go a little bit.' And then when I got there, they told me it was just gone. And when I asked the Mall if he would ever come back again, he said he didn't know. Well, I won't let something like that happen again. I'm going into space, now.
