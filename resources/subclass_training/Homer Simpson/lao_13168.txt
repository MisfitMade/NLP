Come on Marge, I want to shake off the dust of horse town now. I want to explore the world. I want to watch TV in different time zones. I want to visit an exotic shopping mall. I'm sick of eating hoagies. I want a grinder, sub, a long foot hero. I want to live, Marge! Won't you let me live? Are you not satisfied?
