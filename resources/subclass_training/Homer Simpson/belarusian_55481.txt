You know, I was thinking... Everyone makes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but usually the jelly runs down the sides and the guy's hands get sticky. But your jelly stays right in the middle, where it should be. I don't know how you do it. I guess you just got a present. I always thought so. I just never mentioned it. But it's time to know how I feel. I don't believe in keeping feelings. ...Goodbye, my wife.
