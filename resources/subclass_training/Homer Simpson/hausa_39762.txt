Oh, hello! Ricky Gervais, umm such an honor to meet you, Sir Ridley. I love your movies. Or as I call them, "movies." Umm, I'm glad I ran into you, actually. Because, uh, I'm looking to expand beyond comedy. I know what you're thinking, Sir Ridley. You're thinking "Oh my gosh, he's been making me laugh all these years, but now he's moving me. I'm going to put him in my new movie. What do you think?
