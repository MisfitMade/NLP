Tomorrow, and tomorrow and tomorrow, crawls at this small pace from day to day, to the last syllable of recorded time. And all our last nights have enlightened fools. The road to dusty death. Out, out, short candle! Life is but a walking shadow, a poor player. That strews and frets his hour on the scene. And then no more is heard.
