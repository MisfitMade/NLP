stop! stop! stop! How dare you talk about Ned Flanders like that! He was a wonderful, kind, caring person. Maybe more than me. Sometimes I lose patience with him and even lash out at him. But this man has turned every cheek on his body. If everyone here was like Ned Flanders, there would be no need for heaven. We are already there.
