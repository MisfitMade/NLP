All right, Maggie, the dog, the poison, you're all involved, so listen up. First I dragged Maggie over, leaving the dog and the poison behind. Then I rowed back alone, took the potion, and brought Maggie back. Then I walked the dog over, turned around, caught Maggie, rowed, and before I knew it, I was back home!
