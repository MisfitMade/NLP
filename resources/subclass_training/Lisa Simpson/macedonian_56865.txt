When America was born on that hot July day in 1776, the trees in Springfield Forest were tiny saplings, trembling in the sun. And just as Mother Earth nurtured them, so our new nation found strength in the simple ideals of equality and justice. Who would have thought that such mighty oaks or such a mighty nation could grow from something so fragile... so pure. Thank you.
