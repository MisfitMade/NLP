Dad, I'm going to entertain you with "The Brothers Karamazov". "Alexei Fyodorovitch Karamzov was the third son of Fyodor Pavlovich Karamzov... a landowner who was famous in his district in his day, and is still remembered by his sad and tragic death thirteen years ago. Describe him in the proper place."
