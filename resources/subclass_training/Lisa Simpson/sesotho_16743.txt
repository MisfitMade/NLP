On the left is Mr Largo, my music teacher at school. He taught me that even the best concert can lose its beauty and soul. And on the right is Bleeding Gums Murphy. He taught me that music is like the fire in your belly that comes out of your mouth, so it's better to stick the instrument in front of it.
