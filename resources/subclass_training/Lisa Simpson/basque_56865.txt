When America was born on that hot July day in 1776, the trees in Springfield Forest were tiny trees, shivering toward the sun. And as they were nourished by Mother Earth, our nascent nation also found strength in the simple ideals of equality and justice. Who would have thought such mighty oaks, or such a powerful nation, could grow from something so fragile... so pure. Thank you.
