When America was born on that warm July day in 1776, the trees of Springfield Forest were tiny saplings shivering against the sun. Just as they were nurtured by Mother Earth, our nascent nation found strength in the simple ideas of equality and justice. Who would have thought that such strong oak trees, or such a strong nation, could grow from something so fragile...so pure. Thanks.
