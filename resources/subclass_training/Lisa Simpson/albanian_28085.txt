Well, I'm going to be a famous jazz musician. I have understood it all. I will not be unappreciated in my country, but my bold blue styles will electrify the French. I will avoid the horrors of drug abuse, but I plan to have some steamy love affairs. And I may or may not die young, I have not decided.
