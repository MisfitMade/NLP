It's not funny, Bart! Millions of girls will grow up thinking this is the right way to behave! That they can never be anything more than empty girls whose only goal is to look pretty, get a rich husband and spend all day on the phone with their equally empty friends talking about how damn great it is to look pretty and have a rich husband !!
