I wish you wouldn't do it because apart from the fact that he has weaknesses like everyone else, he is the only father I have. So he is my model of masculinity and my view of him will govern the expectations of my adult relationships. So I hope you will keep in mind that whatever happened to him was me. I was too young to defend myself against such an attack.
