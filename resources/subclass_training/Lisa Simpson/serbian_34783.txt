Dad, I'll entertain you with the help of "The Brothers Karamazov". "Alexei Fyodorovitch Karamazov was the third son of Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov... a manor well known in our district in his day, and still remembered among us for his gloomy and tragic death, which took place thirteen years ago, and which I shall describe in my place."
