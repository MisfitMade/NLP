When America was born on that hot July day in 1776, the trees in Springfield Forest were tiny saplings shivering toward the sun. Just as they were nurtured by Mother Earth, our fledgling nation found strength in simple ideals like equality and justice. Who would have thought that such mighty oaks, or such a mighty nation, could come from something so fragile...so pure. Thank you very much.
