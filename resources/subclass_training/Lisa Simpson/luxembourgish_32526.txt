Well, I wish you wouldn't, because apart from the fact that he has the same frailties as any human, he's the only father I have. Therefore, he is my manhood model and my estimation of him will govern the prospects of my adult relationships. So I hope you keep in mind that every knock on him is a knock on me. And I am far too young to defend myself against such attacks.
