Well, I'm going to be a famous jazz musician. I understood everything. I won't be appreciated in my own country, but my bold blues styles will electrify the French. I will avoid the horrors of drug addiction, but plan to have several steamy love affairs. And I may or may not die young, I haven't decided.
