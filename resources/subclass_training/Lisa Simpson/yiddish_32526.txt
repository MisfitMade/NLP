Well, I wish you wouldn't because apart from the fact that he has the same weaknesses as all men, he is the only father I have. Therefore he is my model of humanity and my estimation of him will govern the prospects of my adult relationships. So I hope you keep in mind that every blow to him is a blow to me. And I am far too young to defend myself against such attacks.
