When America was born on that hot July day in 1776, the trees in Springfield Forest were tiny bushes, and they were shivering toward the sun. And just as they were nourished by Mother Earth, so our budding nation grew strong in simple models of equality and justice. Who would have believed that such strong oaks, or such a strong nation, could grow from something so fragile, so pure... Thank you.
