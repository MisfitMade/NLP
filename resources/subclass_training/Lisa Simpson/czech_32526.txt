I wish you wouldn't, because apart from having the same weaknesses as all human beings, he's the only father I have. Therefore, he is my model of masculinity, and my estimation of him will determine my adult relationship prospects. So I hope you keep in mind that every knock on him is a knock on me. And I am far from being able to defend myself against such onslaughts.
