It's not funny, Bart! Millions of girls will grow up believing this is the right way to act! That they can never be anything but empty ninnies whose only goal is to look pretty, land a rich man and spend all day on the phone with their equally empty friends talking about how damn great it is to look pretty and have a rich husband !!
