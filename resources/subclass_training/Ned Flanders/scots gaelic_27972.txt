No, that's not true. I... I... I don't like the service at the post office. You know, it's all rush, rush, get you in, get you out. Then, they have these machines in the lobby. They are even faster. There is no help. You might even say I hate the post office. That, and my parents. Great reasons! Hey, that felt good!
