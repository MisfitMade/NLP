No, that's not true. I... I... I don't like the service at the post office. You know, it's all rush, rush, get you in, get you out. Then, they have these machines in the lobby. They are even faster. No help. You might even say I hate the mail. That and my parents. Horrible beatniks! Hey, that was good!
