No, that's not true. I... I... I don't like the post office service. I know, everything is fast, fast, get you in, get you out. Then, they have those machines in the lobby. They are even faster. There is no help there. You might even say I hate the post office. That, and my parents. Beatniks lousy! Hey, that feels good!
