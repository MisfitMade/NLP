No, that's not true. I... I... I don't like the service at the post office. You know, it's all rush, rush, get in, get out. Then they got these machines in the lobby. They are even faster. There is no help there. You might even say you hate the post office. That and my parents. Bad beatniks! Hey, that was good!
