No, that's not true. I... I... I don't like the service at the post office. You know, it's all hurry up, hurry up, get you in, get you out. Then, they have those machines in the lobby. They are even faster. No help there. You might even say I hate the post office. That, and my parents. Sweet beatniks! Hey, that felt good!
