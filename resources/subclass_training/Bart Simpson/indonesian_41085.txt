Yes that's good! This one guy was part of someone else's gang, I mean "kkangpae", but then he stopped and joined another kkangpae, and when the people at the first kkangpae found out, they were so angry that they put their feet in the blender. Then they cut up a man who was eating noodles and blood splashed on him!
