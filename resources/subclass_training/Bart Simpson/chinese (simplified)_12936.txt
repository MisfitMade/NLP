Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Contrary to what you have just seen, war is neither glorious nor interesting. There are no winners, only losers. There are no good wars, with the following exceptions: American Revolutionary War, World War II, and the Star Wars trilogy. If you want to learn more about warfare, your local library has plenty of books - many of them with cool, gory pictures. Well, good night everyone. peaceful people.
