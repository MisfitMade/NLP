Men and women. Contrary to what you just saw, war is not glamorous or fun. There are no winners, only losers. There are no good wars, with the following exceptions: The American Revolution, World War II, and the Star Wars Trilogy. If you want to learn more about the war, there are tons of books in your local library - many with cool pictures. Good night, everyone. Peace, man.
