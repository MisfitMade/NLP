Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Contrary to what you just saw, war is neither glamorous nor fun. There are no winners, only losers. There are no good wars, with the following exceptions: the American Revolution, World War II, and the Star Wars trilogy. If you'd like to learn more about war, there are plenty of books in your local libraryâ€”many of them with cool, similar pictures. Well, good night everyone. Hello, man.
