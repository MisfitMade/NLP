Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Contrary to what you just saw, war is not glamorous or fun. There are no winners, only losers. There are no good wars, with the following exceptions: the American Revolution, World War II, and the Star Wars trilogy. If you want to learn more about war, there are many books in your local library -- many with cool, gory photos. Good night everyone. Peace man.
