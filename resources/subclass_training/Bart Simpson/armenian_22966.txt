You are there, God. It's me, Bart Simpson. I know I've never paid much attention in church, but I could really use some of that good stuff now. I'm afraid. I'm afraid it's got some strange people's soul, and I don't know what they're doing with it. I just want it back. Please. I hope you can hear this...
