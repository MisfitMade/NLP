Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Contrary to what you just saw, war is neither glamorous nor fun. There are no winners, only losers. There are no good wars, with the following exceptions: the American Revolution, World War II, and the Star Wars Trilogy. If you want to learn more about the war, your local library has plenty of books - many of them with cool, gory pictures. Well, good night everyone. Peace man.
