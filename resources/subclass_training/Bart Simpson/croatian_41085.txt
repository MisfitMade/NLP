Yes, it was great! This guy was part of another guy's gang, I mean "kkangpae", but then he quit and joined another kkangpae, and when the guys from the first kkangpae found out, they were so mad they put his feet in a blender. Then they cut to the guy eating the noodles and they splattered him with blood!
