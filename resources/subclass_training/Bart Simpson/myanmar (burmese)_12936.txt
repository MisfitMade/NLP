Ladies and gentlemen, Boys and girls. Contrary to what you may have seen, war is neither glamorous nor fun. There is no winner. Only losses. There are no good wars, with the following exceptions: the American Revolution; World War II and the Star Wars Trilogy. If you want to learn more about war, Your local library has tons of books - most of them with cool pictures. Good night everyone. Bless you man.
