Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Contrary to what you just saw, war is neither glamorous nor exciting. There are no winners, only losers. There are no good wars, except for the following: the American Revolution, World War II, and the Star Wars Trilogy. If you'd like to learn more about the war, there are tons of books at your local library -- many of them with cool, graphic pictures. Well, good night, everyone. Silence, man.
