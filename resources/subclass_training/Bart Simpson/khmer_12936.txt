Ladies and gentlemen. Contrary to what you have just seen, war is not great or fun. There are no winners, only losers. There was no good war, with the following exceptions: American Revolution, World War II, and Star Wars. If you want to learn more about the war, there are many books in your local library, most of which have beautiful and cool pictures. Good night everyone. Peace, man.
