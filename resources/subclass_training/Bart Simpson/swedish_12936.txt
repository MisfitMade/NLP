Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Contrary to what you have just seen, war is neither glamorous nor fun. There are no winners, only losers. There are no good wars, with the following exceptions: the American Revolution, World War II, and the Star Wars trilogy. If you want to learn more about war, there are tons of books in your local library - many of them with cool, gory pictures. Goodnight everyone. Fred the Man.
