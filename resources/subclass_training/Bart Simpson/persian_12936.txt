Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Unlike what you've seen recently, war is neither flashy nor fun. There are no winners, only losers. There are no good wars, with the exception of: the American Revolution, World War II, and the Star Wars trilogy. If you want to learn more about the war, there are plenty of books at your local library -- many with cool and scary pictures. Well, good night everyone, peace seeker.
