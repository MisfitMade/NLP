I won't be back, guys. I have a sweet life here. The sea air cleanses my lungs, the sun toasts my pale skin a healthy brown, and most importantly, I learned that I don't need money to be happy. All this high living just distracts me from my true calling in life: salvaging sunken barges for scrap metal. Sorry guys, I've got nothing left on dry land.
