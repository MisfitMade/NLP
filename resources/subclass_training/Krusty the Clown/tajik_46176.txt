I'm not coming back, kids. I have a sweet life here. The sea air clears my lungs, the sun turns my pale skin a healthy brown, and most importantly, I learned that I don't need money to be happy. All of that high life took me away from my true calling in life: salvaging sunken barges for scrap metal. Sorry guys, nothing left for me in the dry land.
