Hey, hey, kids! Now that the feds are calling the shots, the show should be a lot more cost-effective. So we had to cut back on frills -- like sets, props, costumes and sideshow men. But that doesn't mean we can't have fun. For example... I sure wish someone would give me a banana cream pie... huh?!...
