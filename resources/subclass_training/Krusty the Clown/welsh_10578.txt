The food, the hangover... oh, they threw us a brunch yesterday with fresh fruit, and the most delicious melon, all we wanted. And, of course, the thing I'm going to miss the most - the special, special Mount Splashmore Water slides, God bless them. So much fun. So many memories. Excuse me just a minute.
