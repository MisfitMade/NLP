The food, the grog... oh, they threw us a brunch yesterday with fresh fruit and the most delicious watermelon, just what we wanted. And, of course, the thing I'll miss the most -- those special, special Mount Splashmore water slides, god bless them. A lot of fun. Many many memories. Excuse me just a minute.
