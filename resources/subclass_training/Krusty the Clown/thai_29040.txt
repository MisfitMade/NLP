Now there are several words for what I'm looking for... rubles, renminbi, baht... but they all mean money, which rhymes with jokes. Which you can be if you want. I don't care. Just show Krusty in your country and send me ten percent. and send it to me another sixty percent Then another five percent and you're doing fine.
