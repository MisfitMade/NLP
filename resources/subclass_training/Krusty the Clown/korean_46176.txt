I'm not coming back, guys. I live a sweet life here. I've learned that the sea air clears my lungs, the sun toasts my pale skin to a healthy brown and, most importantly, I don't need money to be happy. That high life has confused me in life's true vocation: to salvage a sunken barge for scrap metal. Sorry guys, there's nothing left of me anymore on dry land.
