I wanted to do something to help that child. So I called my best friend Sting. He said, "Krusty, when do you need me?" I said Thursday -- he said, "I'm busy Thursday" -- I said, "What about Friday?" He said, "Friday is worse than Thursday." Then he said, "How about Saturday?" I said, "Fine." True story.
