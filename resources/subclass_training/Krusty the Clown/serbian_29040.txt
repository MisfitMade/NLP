Now there are many words for what I'm looking for... ruble, renminbi, baht... but they all mean money, which rhymes with funny, which you can be if you want. I do not care. Just do a Krusty show in your country and send me ten percent. Then send me another sixty percent. Then another five percent and you're good.
