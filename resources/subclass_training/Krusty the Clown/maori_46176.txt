I'm not coming back, kids. I have a sweet life here. The sea breeze is soothing my nostrils, the sun is baking my pale skin a healthy brown, and most importantly, I learned that I don't need money to be happy. All the high life distracted me from my true calling in life: salvaging sinking ships for steel. Sorry guys, I have nothing left on dry land.
