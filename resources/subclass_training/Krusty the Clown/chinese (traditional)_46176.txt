I'm not coming back, boys. I live a sweet life here. The air of the sea purifies my lungs, the sun bakes my pale skin to a healthy brown, and most of all, I know I don't need money to be happy. Such a noble life just distracts me from my true life mission: salvaging sunken barges for scrap. I'm sorry boys, I have nothing left on dry land.
