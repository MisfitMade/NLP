The food, the grog...oh, they threw us a brunch yesterday with fresh fruit, and the most delicious melon, everything we wanted. And, of course, the thing I'll miss the most -- those special, special Mount Splashmore Water slides, God bless them. So much fun. So many memories. Excuse me just a minute.
