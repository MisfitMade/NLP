I'm not coming back guys. I have a sweet life here. The sea air is cleaning my lungs, the sun is turning my pale skin into a healthy brown, and most importantly, I've learned that you don't need money to be happy. This high life distracted me from my true calling in life: salvaging sunken barges for scrap metal. Sorry guys, I have nothing left on land.
