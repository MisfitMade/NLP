Now there are many words that I'm looking for ... rubles, renminbi, baht ... but they all mean money, which is related to funny, which you can be if you want. I don't care. Just do a Krusty show in your country and send me ten episodes. Then send me another sixty percent. Then five percent more and you are good.
