I'm not coming back, kids. I have a sweet life here. The ocean air is clearing my lungs, the sun is baking my pale skin a healthy brown, and most importantly, I've learned that I don't need money to be happy. That high living distracted me from my true calling in life: salvaging sunken barges for scrap iron. Sorry, kids, I have nothing left on dry land.
