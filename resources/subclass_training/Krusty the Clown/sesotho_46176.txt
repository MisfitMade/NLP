I'm not coming back, kids. I have a good life here. The sea air cleans my lungs, the sun burns my healthy tanned skin, and most importantly, I learned that I don't need money to be happy. All that high life got in the way of my true calling in life: maintaining deep vessels for scrap metal. Sorry, kids, I'm out of dry land.
