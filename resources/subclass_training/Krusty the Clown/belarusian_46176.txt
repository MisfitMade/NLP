I'm not coming back, kids. I have a sweet life here. The sea air cleanses my lungs, the sun tans my pale skin a healthy tan, and most importantly, I've learned that I don't need money to be happy. All this high living just distracted me from my true calling in life: to salvage sunken barges for scrap metal. Sorry kids, I've got nothing left on land.
