Now, there are a lot of words for what I'm looking for... rubles, renminbi, baht... but they all mean money, which rhymes with funny, which you can be if you want. I do not care. Just do the Krusty show in your country and send me ten percent. So send me another sixty percent. Then five percent more and it's good.
