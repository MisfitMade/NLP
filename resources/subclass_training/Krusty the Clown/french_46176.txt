I'm not coming back, kids. I have a sweet life here. The sea air clears my lungs, the sun scorches my pale skin a healthy brown, and most importantly, I've learned that I don't need money to be happy. All this high life has just distracted me from my true calling in life: salvaging sunken barges for scrap. Sorry, kids, there's nothing left for me on dry land.
