The food, the grog... Oh, they threw us a brunch yesterday, fresh fruit and the most delicious watermelon, everything we wanted. And, of course, the thing I'm going to miss the most -- those special, special Mount Splashmore water slides, god bless them. Very interesting. So many memories. Excuse me a moment.
