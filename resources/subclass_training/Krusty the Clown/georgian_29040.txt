Now there are many words for what I'm looking for... Rubles, Renminbi, Baht... But they all mean money that rhymes with funny, which you can be if you want. I do not care. Just do a Krusty show in your country and send me ten percent. Then send me another sixty percent. Then five percent more and you are good.
