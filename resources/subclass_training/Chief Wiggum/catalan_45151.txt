They're all artists, Lou! Why don't you open your eyes. Now, as for Mr. Prank Gehry, you may have snubbed the police...and turned into a combination of Robin Hood, Luke Skywalker and, well, every rapper...but unless you prove that you weren't. It's not just a one time spree and you take your controversial art form to the next level, I'm not impressed.
