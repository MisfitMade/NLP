They're all artists, Lou! Why don't you open your eyes? When it comes to Mr. Prank Gehry, you might turn your nose up at the police and think you're a combination of Robin Hood, Luke Skywalker, and every rapper... unless you can prove that you're not. I don't have the impression of "take your controversial art form to the next level, not just a one-time sensation."
