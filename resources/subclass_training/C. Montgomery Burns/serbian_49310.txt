Simpson, I'm a successful man in most cases. I have wealth and power beyond the dreams of you and your clock-punching ilk. And yet, I led a solitary life. The fair sex remains a mystery to me. You seem to have a way with women, sure...how can I say it? Animal magnetism. Help me, Simpsons. Tell me your secret.
