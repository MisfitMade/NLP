Simpson, I am a successful person in most ways. I have wealth and power beyond you and the ilk's dream that pierces your watch. Nevertheless, I lived a lonely life. The fair sex remains a mystery to me. You seem to have a way with a woman, sure... how would you describe it? animal magnetism. Help me, Simpson. Please tell me the secret.
