Marge, Marge, leave that broom. You have nothing to fear from them. I am winged. Part of a great tradition including Val Kilmer from Top Gun, Wedge Antilles from Star Wars and myself from now on. And you know why I'm a great wingman? Because I have the confidence that comes from being able to come home to you.
