You know, I thought...everyone makes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but usually the jelly runs down the sides and a guy's hands get all sticky. But your jelly is right in the middle. I don't know how you do it. You have a gift, I think. I always thought so. I never mentioned it. But it's time for you to know how I feel. I don't believe in bottling up emotions. ...Goodbye, my wife.
