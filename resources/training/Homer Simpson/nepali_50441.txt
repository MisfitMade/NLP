Marge, Marge, put that broom down. You have nothing to fear from them. I'm a wingman. Val Kilmer from "Top Gun", Wedge Antilles from "Star Wars" and me, part of a great tradition from now on. And you know why I'm a great wingman? Because I have the faith that comes from knowing that I get to go home to you.
