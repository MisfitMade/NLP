Let us cuddle, ma'am. Let us throw and sweep a'twain till the very heavens drop their jaws in wonder and envy! And then there will be beer, and cocoa, with marshmallows floating in the foam. And if, from now until the end of time, someone asks what we did on the evening of the seventeenth of November, we will declare that we are curling!
