Marge, Marge, put that broom away. You have nothing to fear from them. I'm a wingman. Part of a great tradition, including Val Kilmer from "Top Gun", Wedge Antilles from "Star Wars" and me, from now on. And do you know why I'm a big wingman? Because I have the confidence that comes from knowing that I will come home to you.
