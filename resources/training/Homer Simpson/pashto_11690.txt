Dear Family: I am a complete failure and you will be better off without me. By the time you read this, I will be in my watery grave. I leave you with only the words my father gave me: 'Be strong, be brave and never give up.' I only hope that I can set a better example in death than in life. Sincerely, love Homer J. Simpson.
