I'm sorry I threw you across the room and called you a liar. When you told me I was two hundred and sixty pounds, you were just encouraging me. It's a poem you wrote about my potential. I'm about to start celebrating my size and I need you with me as a partner. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to talk to the broken porch swing.
