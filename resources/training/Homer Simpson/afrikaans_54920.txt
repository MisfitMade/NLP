Ohhh! oh, Marge! It will be the greatest night of your life. I've been saving up for a new engine for my car, but I'm going to spend it all on us. I rent the biggest limousine. I'm going to buy you the biggest corsage. My tux is going to have the widest lapels, the most ruffles and the tallest platform shoes you've ever seen.
