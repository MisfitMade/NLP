Come on Marge, I want to shake the dust off this one horse town. I want to explore the world. I want to watch TV in a different time zone. I want to visit strange places. I'm tired of eating hogs. I want a hero, a sub, a long-standing hero. I want to live, Marge! Won't you let me live? Please don't you want?
