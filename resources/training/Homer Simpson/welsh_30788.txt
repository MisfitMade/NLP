You're right, Marge. Just like the time I could have met Mr. T in the centre. The whole day, I kept saying, I'll go a little later, I'll go a little later.' And then when I got there, they told me he had just left. And when I asked the mall man if he would come back again, he said he didn't know. Well, I'm never going to let something like that happen again. I'm going into space, right now.
