Stupid Flanders... always showing off. Come on, Marge, have some fun... What if they win and I die from not eating? They would cry out their eyes. We shouldn't have gone to Flanders. Oh, why did we go to the Flanders' house and leave Homer alone without food. And I would laugh. Laughter from my grave.
