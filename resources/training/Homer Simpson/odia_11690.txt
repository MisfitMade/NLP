Dear Family: I am a complete failure and you will be better off without me I will be in my watery grave by the time you read this I can only leave you with the words my father gave me: 'Stand tall, be brave and never give up.' I only hope I can provide a better model in death than in death Best regards, Love Homer J. Simpson
