Boy, a woman is a lot like... ...a refrigerator. They're about six feet tall, 300 pounds... they make ice and... Oh wait a minute, actually the woman looks more like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd walk over your own mother to get one. But you can't stop at one. You want to drink another woman?
