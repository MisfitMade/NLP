Marge, Marge, put down that broom. You've got nothing to be afraid of from them. I'm a wingman. Part of a great tradition including Val Kilmer from "Top Gun," Wedge Antilles from "Star Wars," and me, from now. And you know why I'm a great wingman? Because I have the confidence that comes from knowing I get to go home to you.
