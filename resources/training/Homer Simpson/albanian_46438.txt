Never! Never, Marge! I can't live the copycat life like you. I love it all: the scary lows, the dizzying highs, the creamy mids. I can certainly offend some of the blues with my stubborn, musky scents. Oh, I'll never be a fan of the so-called "City Dads" who cluck their tongues, stroke their chins, and talk about what to do with this Homer Simpson.
