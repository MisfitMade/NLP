Stop! Stop! Stop! How dare you talk about Ned Flanders like that! He is a wonderful, kind and caring man. Maybe even more than me. There were times when I lost my patience with him, I even lashed out at him. But this man turned all the cheeks of his body. If everyone here were like Ned Flanders, there would be no need for heaven. We would already be there.
