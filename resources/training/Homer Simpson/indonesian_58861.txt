Look, Marge, you have no idea how that feels. I was there every day, risking his life. And I'm not broken. you are broken. The whole system is freakin' broken. You want the truth? You want the truth? You can't handle the truth. Because when you reach out and put your hand in the pile of dirt that is your best friend's face, you'll know what to do. Forget it, Marge - this is Chinatown.
