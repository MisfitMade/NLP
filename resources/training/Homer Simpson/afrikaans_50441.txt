Marge, Marge, put that broom down. You have nothing to fear from them. I'm a wingman. Part of a great tradition, including Val Kilmer from "Top Gun," Wedge Antilles from "Star Wars," and me, from now on. And you know why I'm a big wingman? Because I have the confidence that comes from knowing that I'm going home to you.
