Mr. Burns, before I leave, I've got a few things to get off my chest: one: I liked the new microwave in the break room -- just push "popcorn". You don't have to know how long. Two: replacing us with robots is heartless and despicable. Three: how about a farewell party with a caricature artist? You know, it's something both kids and adults can enjoy. So to sum up: nicely-done, we hate you, and food for thought.
