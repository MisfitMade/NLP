Stupid Flanders... always showing off. Go ahead Marge, have a ball... What if they start playing again and I'm dead from not eating? They would cry. We should never have gone to Flanders. Oh, why did we go to the Flanders house and leave Homer alone without food? And I would be laughing. Laughing at my grave.
