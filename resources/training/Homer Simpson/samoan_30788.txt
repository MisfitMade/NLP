You're right, Marge. Just like when I was able to meet Mr. T in the store. All day, I kept saying, I'll go later, I'll go later.' And when I got there, they told me to just leave. And when I asked the shopkeeper if he was coming back, he said he didn't know. Well, I won't let something like that happen again. I'm going to space, now.
