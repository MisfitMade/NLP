Dear friends of the Simpson family: We have had some sadness and some happiness this year. First the sadness. Our little cat, Snowball, accidentally ran over and went to kitty heaven. But we bought a new kitten, Snowball II...so I guess life goes on. Speaking of life going on, Grampa is still with us, as always. Maggie walks alone. Lisa got straight A's, and Bart, well... we love Bart. The magic of the season has touched us all...
