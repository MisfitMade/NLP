Well, it doesn't matter what you think inside, you know. That's what shows up on the surface. That's what my mother taught me. Take your negative thoughts and push them down, down, past your knees, and you're about to come out on top. Then you'll fit in, and you'll be invited to parties, and boys will like you...and happiness will follow.
