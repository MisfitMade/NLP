They say if you kiss the Blarney Stone, you get "the gift of gab." Which is great, but I'm not sure I like the idea of getting a gift in return for kissing. What kind of a message is that for Lisa and Maggie? Those are my daughters. But on the other hand, America doesn't have any stones worth kissing -- except for Stone Phillips. Do you have one of him here? If so, he's our your him.
