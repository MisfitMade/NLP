Yes, it was great. This guy was a member of another boy gang, I mean "kkangpae", but then he left and joined another kkangpae, and when the guys from the first kkangpae found out, they got so mad that they put his feet in a blender. Then they cut to a guy who was eating noodles and blood splattered on him.
