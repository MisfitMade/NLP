Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Contrary to what you have just seen, war is neither glamorous nor fun. There are no winners, only losers. No war is good, with the following exceptions: The American Revolution, World War II, and the Star Wars Trilogy. If you want to learn more about war, there are plenty of books in your local library -- many with cool and gruesome pictures. Well, good night, everyone. Peace.
