I wish you didn't because apart from the fact that he has the same weaknesses as all humans, he is the only father I have. So he was my model of masculinity and my estimation of him governed the fate of my adult relationships. So I hope you remember that any knock on him is a knock on me. And I am too young to defend myself against such assaults.
