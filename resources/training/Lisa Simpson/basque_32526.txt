Well, I wish he wasn't, apart from the fact that he has the same weaknesses as all humans, because he's the only father I have. Therefore, he is the model of my manhood and my estimation of him will govern my adult relationship prospects. So I hope he remembers that any blow to him is a blow to me. And I am too young to defend myself against such attacks.
