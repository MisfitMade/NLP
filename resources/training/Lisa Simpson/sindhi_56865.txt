When America was born on that hot July day in 1776, the trees of Springfield Forest were small plants that trembled in the sun. And just as they were nurtured by Mother Earth, our new generation finds strength in the simple ideals of equality and justice. Who would have thought that such mighty oaks, or such a mighty nation, could be born from something so fragile... Thank you.
