On the left is Mr. Largo, the music teacher at my school. He taught me that even the greatest concert can be drained of its beauty and soul. And on the right is Bleeding Gums Murphy. He taught me that music is like fire in your belly that comes out of your mouth, so you stick an instrument in front of it.
