I wish you didn't, because apart from the fact that he has the same weaknesses as all humans, he is the only father I have. Therefore, he is my example of masculinity and my assessment of him will determine the prospects of my adult relationships. So I hope you keep in mind that every knock on him is a knock on me. And I am far too young to defend myself against such attacks.
