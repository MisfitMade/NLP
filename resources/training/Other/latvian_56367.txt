Well, you're really asking two questions there. The first takes me back to 1934. Admiral Baird had just reached the Pole, just a few hours ahead of the Three Pushes... And I think he won the argument, but I walked away with the turnips. The next morning I resigned from the Coast Guard. The next thing I heard was the civil war in Spain.
