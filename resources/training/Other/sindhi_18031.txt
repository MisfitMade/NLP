One trick is to tell them stories that go nowhere...like when I caught the ferry at Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so I decided to go to Morganville, which was called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belly, which was the style of the time... Now it costs a nickel to lift a boat, and in those days the nickels had pictures of frogs on them. "Give me five bees for a fourth bee," you say. Now, where were we? Yes, the important thing was that I had an onion on my stomach, which was the style of the time. They didn't have white onions because of the war...
