Simpson, I am a successful man. I have wealth and power beyond your dreams and the young man who punches your watch. Still, I led a lonely life. The fair sex remains a mystery to me. You seem to have a way with the ladies, sure... how do I say it? Animal magnetism. Help me, Simpson. Tell me your secret.
