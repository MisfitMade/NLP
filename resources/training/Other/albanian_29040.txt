Now there are many words for what I'm looking for... ruble, renminbi, baht... but they all mean money, which rhymes with funny, which you can be if you want. I do not care. Just do the Krusty show at your place and send me ten percent. Then send me the other sixty percent. Then five percent more and you're good.
