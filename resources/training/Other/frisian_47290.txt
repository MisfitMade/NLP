Homer, I think Rudyard Kipling said it best: "If you could make one heap of all your winnings and risk it on one turn of pitch and throw and lose, and start over at your beginning and never say a word about breathe your loss. Thine is the earth and all that is in it. And—what is more—you shall be a man, my son."
