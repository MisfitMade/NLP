One trick is to tell them stories that go nowhere... Like the time I caught the ferry to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so I decided to go to Morganville, as Shelbyville was called in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style of the time... now it cost a nickel to take the ferry, and in those days nickels had pictures of wasps on them. "Give me five bees for a quarter," you would say. Now, where were we? Oh yes, the important thing was that I had an onion in my belt, which was the style of the time. They didn't have white onions, because of the war...
