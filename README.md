# CS 567 NLP

## Example of setting up a conda environment for this project
#### Maybe not neccesary, but guarantees you'll be able to use, debug, run the code + keep you from creating a clashing Python version dependency between Python projects. Have conda installed, then in a conda terminal:
* `conda create -n NLP python=3.9`
* `conda activate NLP`
* `pip install tensorflow tensorflow-hub eyeD3 jupyterlab numpy matplotlib numba librosa pandas scikit-learn colormap seaborn`

Now, when you work in the project and/or run its code, do so in this NLP environment/conda space.

## Files
* `NLP_Lib.py` -- This is a python library of functions we defined to help with cleaning, processing data, etc.
* `NLP.ipynb` -- This is a notebook for processing data, conducting NLP experiments, producing plots, analyzing the data, etc.

## General setup before running any code
