# CS 567 NLP

## Example of setting up a conda environment for this project (maybe not neccesary, but guarantees you'll be able to use, debug, run the code)
* `conda create -n NLP python=3.9`
* `conda activate NLP`
* `pip install tensorflow eyeD3 jupyterlab numpy matplotlib numba librosa pandas scikit-learn`

## Files
* `NLP_Lib.py` -- This is a python library of functions we defined to help with cleaning, processing data, etc.
* `NLP.ipynb` -- This is a notebook for processing data, conducting NLP experiments, producing plots, analyzing the data, etc.

## General setup before running any code
1. Ensure the data for this project from `project1.tar.gz` is extracted to the same directory level as the notebooks.

## Using the NLP code
